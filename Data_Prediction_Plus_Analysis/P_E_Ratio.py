#Companies P/E Ratio will also be analyzed to see whether the firm is exepcted to grow (i.e, lower P/E ratios)
#The compnaies Beta will also be seen as well to see if their is a relationship between the frims beta and its P/E Rati0
#The idea behind this is that when the P/E ratio is lower the beta should be relatively higher.
#Ex; Higher performing companies tend to be more risky investments like in the technology sector ==> Lower P/E & High Beta.

#This is an test to see if their is any relationship between the two variables
