#Idea is to check the volume changes in the stock in the one year time period to see if their is a trend
#between the firms. That is does the volume change in conjuction for these firms or is this process entirely indepedent of one another.
#Then this will be related to stock prices. For example do higher volume changes imply bigger price increases? Or do lower volume changes
#imply lower prices ?
